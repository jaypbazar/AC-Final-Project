## 📘 Introduction
This project, CipherNest, is an interactive platform designed to allow users to explore and experiment with fundamental cryptographic algorithms. The purpose of CipherNest is to provide a hands-on learning experience with various encryption, decryption, and key exchange concepts. Cryptography is of paramount importance in the digital age, serving as the foundation for secure communication, data protection, and privacy. Understanding its core principles is crucial for anyone involved in information technology and digital security. CipherNest aims to demystify these concepts by providing a clear and engaging platform for users to see cryptographic algorithms in action.

## 🧠 Discussions

<!-- 
o Describe the overall application architecture and UI choice.
o For each implemented cryptographic algorithm:
    ▪ Name and type (Symmetric/Asymmetric/Hash)
    ▪ Brief history/background
    ▪ Description of the process/how it works (can be high-level or include simplified pseudocode)
    ▪ Libraries used for its implementation
    ▪ How it's integrated into your application
 -->

## 🧪 Sample Run / Outputs

<!-- Include screen snippets (screenshots) or text-based output examples for each algorithm's functionality (encryption, decryption, hashing for both text and files where applicable). Embed images directly in the README.md or link to them within the repository. Use Markdown code blocks for text output. -->
