## üìò Introduction

CipherNest is an educational platform designed to simplify the exploration of cryptographic algorithms. The project provides users with an interactive environment to experiment with encryption, decryption, and hashing techniques. Its primary goal is to offer hands-on learning and demystify complex cryptographic concepts.

In the digital era, cryptography is the backbone of secure communication, data protection, and privacy. It is essential for safeguarding sensitive information against threats. CipherNest bridges the gap between theory and practical application, allowing users to understand and appreciate the critical role cryptography plays in technology and security.

### Application Architecture
The CipherNest application is structured as a web-based platform that combines a responsive frontend with a robust backend to support cryptographic algorithm demonstrations. Here's an overview of its architecture:

**1. Frontend:** 

- The user interface is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.
- Navigation between different cryptographic algorithms is facilitated via a well-organized sidebar and buttons.
- Custom templates allow dynamic content rendering using Flask.
  
**2. Backend:** 

- The backend is developed in **Python**, leveraging the **Flask** framework for routing and server-side logic.
- Cryptographic operations are implemented using Python libraries like hashlib, pycryptodome, and custom logic for simpler algorithms.

**3. Routing:**

- Organized through Flask templates to navigate between different cryptographic algorithm demonstrations.

**4. Integration:**

- Inputs from the user are processed through forms, and the backend performs the cryptographic operations. The results are then displayed dynamically on the same page.

### Cryptographic Algorithms

### **1. Caesar Cipher (Symmetric Encryption)**

- **History/Background:** One of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques, attributed to Julius Caesar, who used it to encode military messages.
- **How it Works:** Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
    -  **Pseudocode:**
            <!-- ( Screenshots of a Pseudocode )  -->
- **Libraries Used:** Pure Python implementation (no external libraries).
- **Integration:** Users enter plaintext and a shift value. The backend computes the ciphertext and returns it to the frontend.

### **2. Block Cipher (Symmetric Encryption)**

- **History/Background:** A more modern approach to encryption, block ciphers process data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 64 or 128 bits) using a secret key.
- **How it Works:** Data is divided into blocks, and each block is encrypted independently using a key.
    -  **Pseudocode:**
               <!-- ( Screenshots of a Pseudocode )  -->
- **Libraries Used:** pycryptodome for block cipher implementation.
- **Integration:** Users input text, and the algorithm encrypts it block by block, displaying the resulting ciphertext.

### **3. RSA (Asymmetric Encryption)**
- **History/Background:** Developed in 1977 by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, RSA is a widely-used asymmetric encryption algorithm that relies on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.
- **How it Works:**
    - Key generation involves creating a public and private key pair.
    - Encryption is performed using the recipient's public key, while decryption uses the private key.
    - **Pseudocode:**
        <!-- ( Screenshots of a Pseudocode )  -->
- **Libraries Used:** pycryptodome for key generation and encryption/decryption.
- **Integration:** Users can generate a key pair, encrypt a message with the public key, and decrypt it with the private key.

### **4. ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography - Asymmetric Encryption)**
- **History/Background:** A modern asymmetric encryption technique that relies on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC provides equivalent security to RSA with smaller key sizes.
- **How it Works:** Uses the mathematical properties of elliptic curves to generate keys and perform encryption.
    -  **Pseudocode:**
               <!-- ( Screenshots of a Pseudocode )  -->
- **Libraries Used:** ecdsa or similar Python libraries for elliptic curve operations.
- **Integration:** Users can encrypt and decrypt messages using ECC, with the backend handling key management and computations.

### **5. MD5 (Hashing Algorithm)**
- **History/Background:** A widely-used cryptographic hash function developed in 1991, producing a 128-bit hash value. It is now considered insecure due to vulnerabilities to collision attacks.
- **How it Works:** Takes an input and produces a fixed-size hash value.
- **Libraries Used:** hashlib.
- **Integration:** Users input text to be hashed, and the result is displayed on the frontend.

### **6. SHA-1 (Hashing Algorithm)**
- **History/Background:** Developed by the NSA in 1993, SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash value and was widely used until vulnerabilities were discovered.
- **How it Works:** Processes input in 512-bit blocks to produce a fixed 160-bit hash.
- **Libraries Used:** hashlib.
- **Integration:** Similar to MD5, users can input text, and the hash is computed and displayed.

### **7. SHA-256 (Hashing Algorithm)**
History/Background: Part of the SHA-2 family, it is widely used for cryptographic security and produces a 256-bit hash.
How it Works: Processes input in blocks to produce a fixed-size hash.
Libraries Used: hashlib.
Integration: Accepts user input and displays the resulting hash value.

### **8. SHA-512 (Hashing Algorithm)**
- **History/Background:** A member of the SHA-2 family, producing a 512-bit hash value. It provides stronger security and greater resistance to attacks compared to SHA-256.
- **How it Works:** Similar to SHA-256 but with a larger output size.
- **Libraries Used:** hashlib.
- **Integration:** Users input text, and the hash value is computed and displayed.
