## 📘 Introduction

* CipherNest is an educational platform designed to simplify the exploration of cryptographic algorithms. The project provides users with an interactive environment to experiment with encryption, decryption, and hashing techniques. Its primary goal is to offer hands-on learning and demystify complex cryptographic concepts.
* 
In the digital era, cryptography is the backbone of secure communication, data protection, and privacy. It is essential for safeguarding sensitive information against threats. CipherNest bridges the gap between theory and practical application, allowing users to understand and appreciate the critical role cryptography plays in technology and security.*

## 🧠 Discussions

<!-- 
o Describe the overall application architecture and UI choice.
o For each implemented cryptographic algorithm:
    ▪ Name and type (Symmetric/Asymmetric/Hash)
    ▪ Brief history/background
    ▪ Description of the process/how it works (can be high-level or include simplified pseudocode)
    ▪ Libraries used for its implementation
    ▪ How it's integrated into your application
 -->

## 🧪 Sample Run / Outputs

<!-- Include screen snippets (screenshots) or text-based output examples for each algorithm's functionality (encryption, decryption, hashing for both text and files where applicable). Embed images directly in the README.md or link to them within the repository. Use Markdown code blocks for text output. -->
